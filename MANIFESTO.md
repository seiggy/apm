# The AI-Native Development Manifesto

*As Prompts become the new Code, we value...*

### **Portability over Vendor Lock-in**
Write once, run anywhere. Prompts should execute across any LLM Client without modification. We choose open standards over proprietary ecosystems, ensuring your AI automation investment travels with you.

### **Natural Language over Code Complexity**
Markdown and plain English over complex programming frameworks. If you can write documentation, you can create Prompts. Human-readable processes that are also LLM-executable.

### **Reusability over Reinvention**
Shareable workflow packages with dependency management. Community-driven knowledge capture over siloed tribal knowledge. Build once, benefit many times.

### **Reliability over Magic**
Predictable, step-by-step execution over black-box AI Agent behavior. Transparent processes that teams can audit, understand, and trust. No surprises, just results.

### **Developer Experience over AI Sophistication**
Simple CLI tooling over complex agent frameworks. Fast iteration and local execution over cloud-dependent workflows. 

### **Collaboration over Isolation**
Prompts and workflows as shared first-class AI artifacts. Version controlled, peer reviewed and verifiable.

*These principles guide every decision in APM's design. We believe AI Agents should empower dev teams without overwhelming them, and that the best AI tools are the ones that feel simple and familiar while enabling extraordinary capabilities.*
