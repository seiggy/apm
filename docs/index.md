# APM Documentation

Welcome to the Agent Package Manager (APM) documentation. APM is the AI Package Manager that transforms any project into reliable AI-Native Development - build, package, share, and run agentic workflows across any LLM runtime.

## Quick Start Guide

New to APM? Follow this learning path for the fastest way to get productive:

1. **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)** - Installation, setup, and your first project
2. **[Core Concepts](concepts.md)** - Understanding the AI-Native Development framework  
3. **[Examples & Use Cases](examples.md)** - Real-world workflow patterns and enterprise examples
4. **[Context Guide](primitives.md)** - Build custom workflows and advanced patterns

## Essential References

### Core Innovation
- **[APM Compilation](compilation.md)** - Mathematical context optimization that solves AI agent scalability

### Command Line Interface
- **[CLI Reference](cli-reference.md)** - Complete command documentation with examples
- **[Integration Guide](integrations.md)** - VSCode, Spec-kit, AI runtimes, and tool compatibility

### Framework Implementation  
- **[Context Guide](primitives.md)** - Creating and using the four primitive types
- **[Prompts Guide](prompts.md)** - Creating reusable AI instructions and workflows

## Architecture & Advanced Topics

### Work in Progress
- **[MCP Integration](wip/mcp-integration.md)** - Model Context Protocol tool integration (Phase 2)

### Framework Context
APM implements the complete [AI-Native Development framework](https://danielmeppiel.github.io/awesome-ai-native/docs/concepts/) through:

- **🔧 Layer 1: Markdown Prompt Engineering** - Structured, repeatable AI instructions  
- **⚙️ Layer 2: Context** - Configurable tools that deploy prompt + context engineering  
- **🎯 Layer 3: Context Engineering** - Strategic LLM memory management for reliability

**Result**: Transform from supervising every AI interaction to architecting systems that delegate complete workflows to AI agents.
