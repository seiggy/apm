# Rules to keep documentation up-to-date

- Rule 1: Whenever changes are made to the codebase, it's important to also update the documentation to reflect those changes. You must ensure that the following documentation is updated: [.md files in the docs directory](../../docs/). You can simply update the above markdown files to match the changes in the codebase. 

- Rule 2: The main [README.md](../../README.md) file is a special case that requires user approval before changes, so, if there is a deviation in the code that affects what is stated in the main [README.md](../../README.md) file, you must warn the user and describe the drift and [README.md](../../README.md) update proposal, and wait for confirmation before updating it. 

- Rule 3: Documentation is meant to be very simple and straightforward, we must avoid bloating it with unnecessary information. It must be pragmatic, to the point, succint and practical.To: "**"
